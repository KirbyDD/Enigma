# Enigma Self Assesment

## Functionality => 3. 
Was able to implement encryption, decryption, and file reading/writing

## OOP => 3 or 2. 
My method to encrypt and decrypt are kind of long even though I broke most of it out.

## TDD => 3. 
100% Test coverage. No Mock or Stub.

## Version control => 2. 
Almost all of my commit's only dealt with 1 file or me fixing a type in an additional file
